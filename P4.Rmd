```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Introduction

For this assignment we have given two sets of email messages. One set is known to be spam and another set is known to be "ham", a legitimate message. I have downloaded two files from the example corpus https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/ [@old_publiccorpus_2004]. I have downloaded the files named `20021010_easy_ham.tar.bz2` and `20021010_spam.tar.bz2` containg sample ham and spam messages respectively. I have also made my chosen files available on (github)[]. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
